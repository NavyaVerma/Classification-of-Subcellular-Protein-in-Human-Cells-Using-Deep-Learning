**AIM**<br>
The aim of this project is to develop a model capable of classifying mixed patterns of proteins in microscopic images. This model can then be used further to identify a proteinâ€™s location from a high throughput image.

**OBJECTIVES**<br>
The Cell Atlas in the Human Protein Atlas (HPA) program has built a dataset involving hundreds of thousands of high-resolution immunofluorescent microscopy images of human cells which detail the subcellular distribution pattern of proteins in these cells. Recognizing subcellular distribution of proteins with these images can be the key to our understanding of protein function, interactions, cellular biology and human disease, and it requires accurate classifications of the large number of microscopy images. Our objective is to provide a deep learning framework that can be trained and deployed in real time and is able to classify these mixed patterns of proteins in microscopic images.
